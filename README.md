## Problem Solving approach
Throughout our project we had severe challenges which led us to a new approach to solve problems.
We learnt to split our issues into multiple small issues, create a list of tasks to work on in order and use pseudo-code before tackling the challenge.

## Tools Used
Discord
VS Code Live Share extension
Github Project Board
Software Methodologies
During our planning stage, we identified there were functions and components that would be reused in the project. As a result, we decided to include modularization and attempted to follow the DRY principle.
